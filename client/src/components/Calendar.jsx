//The Calendar component is a table where the first row is the table headers.
//The body of the table consists of ChoreRow components which are mapped from
//the chores array. Items are added to the chores array by way of a POST request
//from the ChoreInput component and the chores array is populated by a GET request
//to the chores table in the database. Many props are passed down into ChoreRow
//so that they can be used in ChoreCell.
//As each chore is being mapped to a ChoreRow, it also loops through the array of
//completedChores. If the completedChores array contains a chore that matches the
//chore associated with the ChoreRow, it will pass down an array of tuples which
//contains the name of the user who completed the chore and the dayId (a number).
//These tuples will be used in the ChoreRow component and passed down to the 
//ChoreCell component in order to render the names of users who completed that chore
//on the specified day. Basically, we are rendering the database on the client.
